## Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals chart

**Project Overview

  ###The purpose and background of this project was to determine the outcomes based on launch date and goals at the Louiseâ€™s play Fever fundraising. The goal was achieved in a short amount of time and she wanted to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

**Analysis and Challenges

  ###In this project, we reviewed the theater outcomes based on launch date and observed no relationship between the lunch dates and the total percentage outcomes. See image 1 below.
  
   ###Some of the challenges encountered during this analysis inlcudes ensuring the row labels are changed to display the months of the year, and the       campaign outcomes are sorted in descending order, i had some diffculty createing the line chart is created and ensuring i show the number of successful,  failed, canceled projects by month and the title.

  ###This outcomes showed no relationship with the amount of successful, Failed and Canceled

**Results

##What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? based on the chart, i do not believe there is a relationship, each outcome was significantly didfferent.

##What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Based on the chart, there seem to be a level of relationship.

##What are some limitations of this dataset? The criteria could have been different and the ranges was to broad.

##What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? percentage canceled added no value to the data needed, this should have been skipped. The chart did use the specific data criteria during the chart trend.
